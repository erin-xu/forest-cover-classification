# forest-cover-classification
A deep learning model to predict forest cover type from cartographic variables

This project uses the forest cover type dataset in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data is provided by US Geological Survey and USFS, consisting of 30 x 30 meter areas across 4 wilderness areas in Roosevelt National Forest. 

- Model performance was improved through hyperparameter tuning, and overfitting was prevented using early stopping.
- This model achieved an accuracy of 89% when evaluated on test set data.
